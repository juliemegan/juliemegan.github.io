This page was built using HTML, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap. It hosted locally for development
via Apache 2.4. It is currently hosted on the web via github pages. 
I utilized my time commuting to Chicago from 
the suburbs via the Metra train rail to develop this page over the span of a few months.
It took several iterations to design the look and feel I was attempting for this page. 
My page was inspired by the picture below. Feedback is welcomed!
